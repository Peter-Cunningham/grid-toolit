This is a helper library for a UK Civil Service 'GRID'

It is intended to simplify routine actions for these staff members, whilst also ensuring they will success without requiring any python libraries which are blocked by local IT policies.

Altohugh use will be limited to those not associated with the internal Civil Service project, other may face similar issues on their corporate networks and hopefully this code may be useful to them.

This library is currently under construction, documentation to be updated in due course.
